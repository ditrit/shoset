# Ideas for Improvements and changes :

- Add a description to the GitHub repository.
- Integration of the routing system into other message types.
    - Use route system to forward PKI requests
    - command
- Redo the polling based wait in some handlers with the event based system from event, simple mesage and forwardAck.
- Finish adaptation to arbitrary network topology.
- Cleaning up Gandalf specific things that are not used anymore.
- Rerouting the entire network every time is not optimal.
- Comprehensive status system for shosets and shosetConns using the event bus.
- Optimize mutex in Shoset and ShosetConn.
- Test with many shosets in a single Lname.
- Separate the project in smaller packages :
    - Put mapsyncmap in a dedicated package.
    - Put config in a dedicated package.
- Launch at the same time multiple shosets.
- Fix script `cert_checker.sh`.
- Function to use Protocol without relaunching saved connections.
- Need an IDE agnostic way to launch many scripts in many dedicated terminals at once. (Or Doker containers).
- `README.md` :
  - Fix the links.
  - Update the content.
